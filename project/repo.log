Boyd (16):
      Added Junit 5 to the classpath.
      Added some basic tests for the Item class
      Added some tests for stock, more to come soon
      Began implementation of the Store class. Added a large number of tests focused on various classes involving more complex scenarios, such as manifest stock checking and stock sale/purchase costs.
      Implemented the truck classes.
      test
      should be good now
      Added the getManCost function to stock and modified the syntax used in the Truck classes
      Added a getter method for the hashmap containing stock
      Added the export manifest function. This file contains the function, put it in the Store class/ the first 3 lines are how to actually call the function. They should go at the end of exportManifest().
      Added a getter function for the list of trucks contained in a manifest.
      index on master: 1a8df19 Added a getter function for the list of trucks contained in a manifest.
      On master: Added the 3 exception classes and javadoc documentation style comments
      Added the 3 exception classes, CSVFormatException, DeliveryException and StockException
      <Auto Generated by Git> Merged the branch actually containing the changes to master.
      Added exporting of manifests, doesnt 100% work but its functional. Also fixed some memory issues in manifest class, specifically incorrect use of variables. Added several debugging messages too.
